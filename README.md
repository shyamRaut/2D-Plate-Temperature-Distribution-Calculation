# 2D-Plate-Temperature-Distribution-Calculation
2D Plate Temperature Distribution Calculation
This project calculates the temperature distribution in a 2D plate using the given formula. The temperature distribution is plotted using the contourf function from the matplotlib library.

Governing Equation
The governing equation for the temperature distribution in a 2D plate is given by:

Governing Equation

where:

T is the temperature distribution in the 2D plate
t is time
α is the thermal diffusivity
∇^2 is the Laplacian operator.
Usage
To run the project, simply run the Temperaturefunction(N) function with different values of N to see the temperature distribution for different approximations. The function takes in one parameter, N, which is the number of terms used to approximate the solution.
